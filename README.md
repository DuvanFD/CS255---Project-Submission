# CS255-Project-Submission

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass wanted to implement a website that allows customers to create an account, purchase a study lesson package, study and test exams online, schedule apointments with the driving instructors to practice. DriverPass provides a way fro students to study their theoretical driving exams, and schedule appointments to practice their practical driving tests. DriverPass staff also have the ability to purchase packages for clients and schedule their appointments. 

### What did you do particularly well?

The overall understanding of all the aspects required to submit to clients. 


### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Perhaps work on the limitation section, both try to identify more in depth limitations and also work on solutions to eliminate basic limitations. 

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Working on the requirements are key. When implementing the business requirements one must focus on the clients needs and ask, keeping in mind all the technical aspects and vizualizing how the system would work to work with the it team as well to finalize a complete product.  


### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Thinking in terms of functional and non-functional requirements was very helpful for software design. I also felt that creating use case, UML, and Gantt diagrams was very helpful for visualization and giving others a better understanding of what the application should do.
